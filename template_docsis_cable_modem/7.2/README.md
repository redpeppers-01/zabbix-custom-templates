## Requirements

- Cable modem must support standard DOCSIS MIBs:
  - DOCS-IF-MIB
  - DOCS-CABLE-DEVICE-MIB
  - DOCS-BPI-PLUS-MIB
  - HOST-RESOURCES-MIB

## Self-Contained Processing

This template is completely self-contained and requires no external scripts or additional installations. All processing is handled through built-in Zabbix functionality:

### Pre-Equalization Analysis
The template includes embedded JavaScript preprocessing for real-time pre-equalization analysis:

```javascript
// Built-in JavaScript preprocessor handles:
- Hex data parsing from SNMP responses
- Complex tap calculations (magnitude/phase)
- Main tap identification
- Energy distribution analysis
- Distance calculations
- Automated health assessment
- Dynamic recommendations
```

Key JavaScript Functions:
- `parsePreEQ()`: Analyzes upstream pre-equalization data
- `parseSigQEQ()`: Processes signal quality equalization metrics

The preprocessing logic:
1. Converts hex strings to numerical values
2. Calculates tap magnitudes and phases
3. Identifies main tap position
4. Computes relative power levels
5. Determines tap status (OK/Marginal/Poor)
6. Estimates physical distances to faults
7. Generates human-readable analysis
8. Provides specific troubleshooting recommendations

Everything is processed within Zabbix's native preprocessing pipeline, requiring no external dependencies or maintenance.

## Built-in Documentation and Troubleshooting

### Network Interface Discovery

The template uses Low-Level Discovery (LLD) with filtering to automatically detect and monitor network interfaces. The discovery process uses a customizable filter:

![LLD Filter Configuration](img/lld.png)

```yaml
filter:
  evaltype: AND
  conditions:
    - macro: '{#IFOPERSTATUS}'
      value: ^1$
    - macro: '{#IFTYPE}'
      value: ^(6|127|128|129)$
```

Filter Explanation:
- Only discovers operational interfaces (ifOperStatus = 1)
- Default interface types included:
  * 6: ethernetCsmacd (Ethernet)
  * 127: docsCableMaclayer (DOCSIS MAC)
  * 128: docsCableDownstream (DOCSIS Downstream)
  * 129: docsCableUpstream (DOCSIS Upstream)

Value Mapping:
- Predefined mappings for interface states and types
- Service state mapping (Up/Down)
- Automatically translates numeric values to human-readable text
- Example: 0 -> "Down", 1 -> "Up" for interface status

Customization:
- The interface type filter can be extended
- Additional types can be added by modifying the regex
- Example adding WiFi (71): ^(6|71|127|128|129)$
- Any valid IANA ifType can be included

This filtering ensures:
- Only active interfaces are monitored
- Reduces unnecessary items
- Focuses on relevant interfaces
- Flexible for different requirements

### Graphs

The template includes network traffic graphs for discovered interfaces:

- Interface Traffic Graph
  * Shows inbound/outbound bandwidth utilization
  * Green line: Incoming traffic
  * Red line: Outgoing traffic
  * Gradient fill for better visibility
  * Auto-scales based on interface speed

### Triggers
- Signal level violations
- Security state changes
- Performance degradation
- Hardware issues
- Configuration problems

### Graphs
- Signal levels over time
- Error rates
- Channel utilization
- Network traffic

## Troubleshooting Priority

1. Physical Layer Issues
   - Check signal levels
   - Verify cable connections
   - Inspect RF path

2. Configuration Problems
   - Review DOCSIS config
   - Check provisioning
   - Verify security settings

3. Performance Issues
   - Monitor error rates
   - Track timeout events
   - Analyze channel stability

## Support

### MIBs used for reference
> Note: These MIBs are listed for reference only and are not required for template operation since all SNMP queries use direct OID numbers.

- IF-MIB
- SNMPv2-MIB
- DOCS-IF-MIB
- DOCS-CABLE-DEVICE-MIB
- HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
- DOCS-BPI-PLUS-MIB

The template is designed to work without MIB files by using explicit OID numbers in all SNMP queries, making deployment simpler and more portable across different environments.

### Compatibility
- DOCSIS 2.0/3.0/3.1 modems
- Major cable modem vendors
- Standard DOCSIS features
